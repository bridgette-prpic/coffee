    <h1>☕️ Coffee</h1>
    <p>
      The history of coffee began in Ethiopia and Yemen, where it was used in
      the 15th century by Sufi monasteries to aid concentration during prayers.
      It spread to the Levant and then to Europe in the 16th century, causing
      debates over its acceptability in different societies. By the late 17th
      century, coffee houses were common in Western Europe, and cultivation had
      begun in the New World, particularly in the Caribbean. Brazil became the
      world's largest coffee producer by 1852, a position it still holds, while
      other countries like Colombia, Ethiopia, and Vietnam also became major
      producers in the 20th century. Today, coffee is a globally popular
      beverage with a profound cultural and economic influence.
